                <h4>How to make Cold Tres Leches Dessert:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li> Wash the potatoes very well, peel them and cut them into short strips. Preheat the oil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan or skillet.</li>
                    <li> Wash the potato wedges with water and dry them very well with a paper towel or an absorbent cloth. It is important that they are dry when frying.</li>
                    <li> Throw the potato wedges into the skillet when the oil is very hot. Fry for 5 to 8 minutes or until just beginning to brown, the texture of the potatoes in this dish is more soft than crunchy so don't toast them too much.</li>
                    <li> Cut the sausages at a steep angle for a more playful look.</li>
                    <li> Boil the sausages in water for 5 to 10 minutes , when they inflate they will be ready. Strain the water very well so that the potatoes do not get wet when integrating them.</li>
