                <h4>How to make Cold Tres Leches Dessert:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>To prepare the tres leches dessert with cookies, start by dissolving the unflavored gelatin in a cup of warm water.</li>
                    <li>Bring the water with the dissolved gelatin to a boil and let the mixture cool. Then, blend the condensed milk, the milk cream, the liquid milk and the dissolved gelatin .

                        Tip: Milk cream is also known by the name of cream in some European countries.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, in a preferably glass container, build a base with the Maria or milk cookies . You can moisten them in the same milk mixture that you already have prepared. Don't over-soak them as they will split. You can also make the tres leches dessert with Ducales cookies.</li>
                    <li>When you have the cookie base ready, add the contents of the blender. You should put the preparation in the refrigerator until the mixture sets. The cold tres leches dessert process can take a day.</li>
                    <li>When you serve the cold tres leches dessert , remember that you can decorate it with a little Swiss meringue , chocolate ganache or a red fruit coulis . If you like, you can also try our tres leches cake recipe . Enjoy!</li>
